		<h1 style="color:orange">Welcome to my climbing page!</h1>
		<p>I started rock climbing back in Dec. 2014 in Santa Cruz, Ca. My first climb ever attempted was at Castle Rock State Park, and called <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105734687/the-great-roof" target="_blank">"the Great Roof," </a> rated 5.10b. I struggled and pushed myself as hard as I could go and...
		<em>I failed!</em>
		</p>
		<p>Still I had a blast learning the set up and safety protocal and combining he physical and <em>mental</em> challenge that climbing entails. Later that week, I joined <a href="http://pacificedgeclimbinggym.com" target="_blank">Pacific Edge</a>, a local climbing gym and started honing my technique on a regular basis. That combined with reading and practicing safety skills leads to some fun adventures outside!</p>
