			<h1>Welcome to my climbing page!</h1>
			<h3>In the beginning...</h3>
			<p>I started rock climbing back in Dec. 2014 in Santa Cruz, Ca.
			  My first climb ever attempted was at Castle Rock State Park,
			  and called
			  <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105734687/the-great-roof" target="_blank">"the Great Roof," </a>
			  rated 5.10b. I struggled and pushed myself as hard as I could go and...
			  <em>I failed!</em></p>
			<p>Still I had a blast learning how to set up, stay safe and enjoy the physical
			  and <em>mental</em> challenge that climbing
			  entails. Later that week, I joined
			  <a href="http://pacificedgeclimbinggym.com" target="_blank">Pacific Edge</a>,
			  a local climbing gym and started honing my technique on a regular basis.
			  That combined with reading about and practicing safety skills lead to some fun adventures outside!</p>
			<h2>Noteworthy climbs</h2>
			<h3>Regular Northwest Face of halfdome</h3>
			<p><img src="doubleCracks.jpeg" style="padding:10px;float:left;height:375px;width=300px">
				We took 6 months to get ready. My partner, Eric, and I had been training in the gym, 
				leading cracks outside and practicing aid and big wall techniques. We were prepared. 
				In July 2018, the day after the park opened after being closed due to smoke, 
				we headed up the "death slabs" to begin the journey. We camped at the base of the wall. 
				I hardly slept because of the mosquitos.</p>
			<p>We began climbing at 3am, and were aiming to finish before dark. 
				Everything was going well, although we were moving slower than we hoped. 
				Route finding wasn't too bad. Bolt ladders were reachy (I'm 5 foot 9) but within 
				reach. Then we got to the "rope toss" pitch.</p>
			<p>There used to be a huge ledge big enough to sleep on and walk across if you needed to.
				 A friend did that the previous year. That ledge fell off during a rock fall event.
				 Now there's a complicated series of steps you have to do involving tossing your rope
				 horizontally 30 feet, getting it stuck behind a crack and pulling yourself past the 
				 now blank section of rock to the <em>chimneys.</em> It took me and Eric almost 3 
				 hours to get past that pitch. I led the next three pitches up the chimneys and past 
				 the double cracks pitch.</p>
			<p>At least we though we were past the double cracks pitch. Eric started up a grainy 
				loose corner which we realized wasn't climbed often. <em>We were off route!</em> We 
				lowered down and discovered Big Sandy Ledge was just below and to the right of us. 
				When we got there, the sun had set.</p>
			<p>We came prepared for a light bivy and anchored ourselves to the wall. 
				I laid down on a perfect bed sized ledge wearing a down jacket. 
				Eric stuffed himself into a garbage bag and slept over the rope which he arranged 
				into a matress. Every now and then during the night I could feel a rat or mouse 
				scurrying around me. I had one dream I was falling. </p>
			<p>The next morning we woke up and eased into the day. There was no rush to finish since we only 
				had 6 pitches to go. Breakfast was gatorade and cliff bars. We made it past the zig zags 
				about 3 hours. Eric led the <em>Thank God Ledge</em> Hunnold style: back to the wall,
			    facing out, scary. I crawled along since I had a backpack on.</p>
			<p>We topped out around 3pm, hiked down the slabs, took a big nap then headed home.</p>

			<h3 style="clear:left">Son of Dawn Wall</h3>
			<p>Whoever says climbing on the west side of Pinnacles is sketchy probably doesn't climb there enough.
			  Once you get used to the strange rock, you can find yourself on some real gems.
			  The squeeze chimney pitch on this climb
			  is high up and as fun and protectable as they come. There was one pretty scary pitch leading up to it.</p>
			
			<h3>South Face of Washington Column/Royal Arches Link-up</h3>
			<p><img src="royalArches.jpeg" style="padding:10px;float:right;height:375px;width=300px">
				Royal Arches is always a fun climb on it's own. 
				Combining it with North Dome's south face is really something to remember. 
			  Our first try, after completing the 16 pitch RA approach, we quickly realized we lacked
			  the proper <em>lie back</em> technique... we bailed.</p>
			<p>The next morning we headed to the valley to practice<em>liebacking</em> on shorter climbs.
			</p>
			<p>Our second attempt of the dome, we got to our previous high point and pushed onward.
			  The final pitch is supposed to be the most difficult: a 5.8 <em>lieback</em>. I was to lead that pitch.
			  My partner, Eric, led an entire length of rope up to what we thought was the beginning of the final pitch.
			  I followed, cleaning all the gear he left behind and towing the
			  backpack. I felt like I weighed 300 pounds. It was so strenuous. This pitch was supposed to be 5.7
			  and I'm supposed to lead the next, <em>harder</em> one. Turns out Eric accidentally lead this one by
			  going so far on the rope. I led the next section which  was easy,
			  until we got off route. Eric took over lead, then went up about 30 feet and placed a nut and went up another
			  30 feet. I shouted up to him where I thought the route might go and I heard a loud "SHHHH!!!" I paid out
			  a few more feet of rope then heard dry heaving. Even after checking the topo, I'm still not sure
			  where the top of this route lies. All I know is we weren't on it and it was pretty hard and scary,
			  especially for Eric. Anyway, we made it to the top. I'm glad I've never hiked to the top of North Dome
			  because the view from up top was even more enjoyable.</p>
			
			<h3>Crest Jewel</h3>
			<p>Another route on North Dome in Yosemite! This is a lower angle <em>slab</em> route.
			  There are almost no handholds, instead you delicately place your feet on small features of the rock
			  and trust that the rubber on your shoes will stick.
			  Again, the views were incredible!
			<h2>One day, I will climb...</h2>

			<h2>Training</h2>

				<p>Part of staying safe in the mountains is maintaining your fitness! 
				A strong cardio system is vital, especially when the climb your dealing 
				with has a long approach. Cycling and hiking are two ways 
				I enjoy keeping up my cardio.</p>
				<p>
				Still nothing gets you in better shape for climbing than <em>climbing!</em> 
				Here I am toproping the crux of 
				<a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105722113/hot-rocks" target="_blank">
				<i>hotrocks</i>,</a> an 11.b finger crack.<big>(Beta Alert!)</big> 
				This crack is particularly difficult because it is not a straight in crack. 
				There are many features outside the crack itself that must be used as well as 
				friction against the sides of the wall. It's sort of a puzzle.
				</p>
			
			<p style="clear:right;padding:10px"><img style="float:right" height ="450"src="IMG_1202.jpg">
				The size of the crack varies with some being very wide and awkward 
				such as this "offwidth" crack. Here, you can't quite jam your whole 
				body in and it is too large to constrict around your hand. 
				This makes the technique the most strenuous form of climbing, 
				at least for me!
