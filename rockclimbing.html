			<h1>Welcome to my climbing page!</h1>
			<h3>In the beginning...</h3>
			<p>I started rock climbing back in Dec. 2014 in Santa Cruz, Ca. My first climb ever attempted was at Castle Rock State Park, and called <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105734687/the-great-roof" target="_blank">"the Great Roof," </a> rated 5.10b. I struggled and pushed myself as hard as I could go and...
			<p><em>I failed!</em></p>
			</p>
			<p>Still I had a blast learning how to set up, stay safe and enjoy the physical and <em>mental</em> challenge that climbing entails. Later that week, I joined <a href="http://pacificedgeclimbinggym.com" target="_blank">Pacific Edge</a>, a local climbing gym and started honing my technique on a regular basis. That combined with reading and practicing safety skills lead to some fun adventures outside!</p>
			<h2>Noteworthy climbs</h2>
			<h3>Regular Northwest Face of halfdome</h3>
			<p><img src="doubleCracks.jpeg" style="padding:10px;float:left;height:375px;width=300px">
				We took 6 months to get ready. My partner, Eric, and I had been training in the gym, 
				leading cracks outside and practicing aid and big wall techniques. We were prepared. 
				In July 2018, the day after the park opened after being closed due to smoke, 
				we headed up the "death slabs" to begin the journey. We camped at the base of the wall. 
				I hardly slept because of the mosquitos.</p>
			<p>We began climbing at 3am, and were aiming to finish before dark. 
				Everything was going well, although we were moving slower than we hoped. 
				Route finding wasn't too bad. Bolt ladders were reachy (I'm 5 foot 9) but within 
				reach. Then we got to the "rope toss" pitch.</p>
			<p>There used to be a huge ledge big enough to sleep on and walk across if you needed to.
				 A friend did that the previous year. That ledge fell off during a rock fall event.
				 Now there's a complicated series of steps you have to do involving tossing your rope
				 horizontally 30 feet, getting it stuck behind a crack and pulling yourself past the 
				 now blank section of rock to the <em>chimneys.</em> It took me and Eric almost 3 
				 hours to get past that pitch. I led the next three pitches up the chimneys and past 
				 the double cracks pitch.</p>
			<p>At least we though we were past the double cracks pitch. Eric started up a grainy 
				loose corner which we realized wasn't climbed often. <em>We were off route!</em> We 
				ered down and discovered Big Sandy Ledge was just below and to the right of us. 
				When we got there, the sun had set.</p>
			<p>We came prepared for a light bivy. We anchored ourselves to the wall. 
				I laid down on a perfect bed sized ledge wearing a down jacket. 
				Eric stuffed himself into a garbage bag and slept over the rope which he arranged 
				into a matress. Every now and then during the night I could feel a rat or mouse 
				scurrying around me. I had one dream I was falling. </p>
			<p>The next morning we woke up and eased into the day. No rush to finish since we only 
				had 6 pitches to go. Breakfast was gatorade and some bars. We made it past the zig zags 
				about 3 hours. Eric led the <em>Thank God Ledge</em> Hunnold style: back to the wall,
			    facing out, scary. I crawled along since I had a backpack on.</p>
			<p>We topped out around 3pm, hiked down the slabs, took a big nap then headed home.</p>

			<h3 style="clear:left">Son of Dawn Wall</h3>
			<p>Whoever says climbing on the west side of Pinnacles is sketchy probably doesn't climb there enough. Once you get used to the strange rock, you can find yourself on some real gems. The squeeze chimney pitch on this climb is high up and as fun and protectable as they come. There was one pretty scary pitch leading up to it.</p>
			
			<h3>South Face of Washington Column/Royal Arches Link-up</h3>
			<p><img src="royalArches.jpeg" style="padding:10px;float:right;height:375px;width=300px">
				Royal Arches is always a fun climb on it's own. 
				Combining it with North Dome's south face is really something to remember. 
				Our first try, after completing the RA approach, we started up North Dome's left 
				ng dihedral (pitch 2 on the dome, pitch 20 or so that day) and quickly realized we 
				couldn't climb this style.</p> 
			<p>We bailed.</p>
			<p>The next morning we headed to the valley to practice on shorter climbs 
				the <em>lie back</em> style of climbing. This closely models the climbing 
				style high up on North Dome.
			</p>
			<p>Our second attempt of the dome, we got to our previous high point and pushed onward. The final pitch is supposed to be the most difficult: a 5.8 <em>lieback</em>. I was to lead that pitch. My partner, Eric, led an entire length of rope up to what we thought was the beginning of the final pitch. I followed, cleaning all the gear he left behind and towing the backpack. I felt like I weighed 300 pounds. It was so strenuous. This pitch was supposed to be 5.7 and I'm supposed to lead the next, <em>harder</em> one. Turns out Eric accidentally lead this one by going so far on the rope. The next section was easy, until we got off route. I heard Eric dry heaving after he got past a difficult section over a huge runout above a nut. I probably would have wet myself. We made it to the top just after nightfall. 
			
			<h3>Crest Jewel</h3>
			<p>Another route on North Dome in Yosemite! This is a low angle <em>slab</em> route. There are almost no handholds, instead you delicately place your feet on small features of the rock and trust that the rubber on your shoes will stick. The views were incredible!

			<h2>Training</h2>
				<p>Part of staying safe in the mountains is maintaining your fitness! 
				A strong cardio system is vital, especially when the climb your dealing 
				with has a long approach. Cycling and hiking are two ways 
				I enjoy keeping up my cardio.</p>
			<p><video height="450" style="float:right"src="video-1553537920.mp4" controls></video>
				Still nothing gets you in better shape for climbing than <em>climbing!</em> 
				Here I am toproping the crux of 
				<a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105722113/hot-rocks" target="_blank">
				<i>hotrocks</i>,</a> an 11.b finger crack.<big>(Beta Alert!)</big> 
				This crack is particularly difficult because it is not a straight in crack. 
				There are many features outside the crack itself that must be used as well as 
				friction against the sides of the wall. It's sort of a puzzle.
			</p>
			
			<p style="clear:right"><img style="float:right" height ="450"src="IMG_1202.jpg">
				The size of the crack varies with some being very wide and awkward 
				such as this "offwidth" crack. Here, you can't quite jam your whole 
				body in and it is too large to constrict around your hand. 
				This makes the technique the most strenuous form of climbing, 
				at least for me!
