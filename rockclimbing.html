		<h3>How I started</h3>

		<p>I started rock climbing back in Dec. 2014 in Santa Cruz, Ca. My first climb ever attempted was at Castle Rock State Park, and called <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105734687/the-great-roof" target="_blank">"the Great Roof," </a> rated 5.10b. I struggled and pushed myself as hard as I could go and...
		<em>I failed!</em>
		</p>
		<p>Still I had a blast learning how to set up, stay safe and enjoy the physical and <em>mental</em> challenge that climbing entails. Later that week, I joined <a href="http://pacificedgeclimbinggym.com" target="_blank">Pacific Edge</a>, a local climbing gym and started honing my technique on a regular basis. That combined with reading and practicing safety skills lead to some fun adventures outside!</p>

		<h2><i>Noteworthy</i> climbs</h2>
		<h3>Regular Northwest Face of halfdome</h3>
		<p>We took 6 months to get ready. Eric and I had been training in the gym, leading 5.10 cracks outside and practicing aid and big wall techniques. We were prepared. In July 2018, the day after the park opened after being closed due to smoke, my partner and I headed up the "death slabs" to begin an epic journey. We camped at the base of the wall. I hardly slept because of the mosquitos.</p>
		<p>We began climbing at 3am, and were aiming to finish before dark. Everything was going well, although we were moving slower than we hoped. Route finding wasn't too bad. Bolt ladders were reachy (I'm 5'9") but within reach. Then we got to the "rope toss" pitch.</p>
		<p>There used to be a huge ledge big enough to sleep on or walk across if you needed to. A friend did that the previous year. That ledge fell off during a rock fall event. Now there's a complicated series of steps you have to do involving tossing your rope horizontally 30 feet, getting it stuck behind a crack and pulling yourself past the now blank section of rock to the <em>chimneys.</em> It took me and Eric almost 3 hours to get past that pitch. I led the next three pitches up the chimneys and past the double cracks.</p>
		<p>At least we though we were past the double cracks pitch. Eric started up a grainy loose corner which we realized wasn't climbed often. <em>We were off route!</em> We lowered down and discovered Big Sandy Ledge was just below and to the right of us. The sun had set.</p>
		<p>We came prepared for a light bivy. We anchored ourselves to the wall. I laid down on a perfect bed sized ledge wearing a down jacket. Eric stuffed himself into a garbage bag and slept over the rope which he arranged into a matress. Every now and then during the night I could feel a rat or mouse scurrying around me. </p>
		<p>The next morning we woke up and eased into the day. No rush. We made it past the zig zags in about 3 hours. Eric led the <em>Thank God Ledge</em> Hunnold style: back to the wall, facing out, scary. I crawled along since I had a backpack on.</p>
		<p>We topped out around 3pm, hiked down the slabs, took a big nap then headed home.</p>

		<h3>Son of Dawn Wall</h3>
		Whoever says climbing on the west side of Pinnacles is sketchy probably doesn't climb there enough. Once you get used strange rock, you can find yourself on some real gems. The squeeze chimney pitch on this climb is as fun and protectable as they come.
		
		<h3>South Face of Washington Column/Royal Arches Link-up</h3>
		<p>Royal Arches is always a fun climb on it's own. Combining it with North Dome's south face is really something to remember. Our first try, after completing the RA approach, we started up North Dome's left facing dihedral (pitch 2 on the dome, pitch 20 or so that day) and quickly realized we couldn't climb this style.</p> 
		We bailed.
		<p>The next morning we got on a single pitch <em>lieback</em> style of climbing down in the valley for practice. This closely models the climbing style high up on North Dome</p>
		<p>Our second attempt of the dome, we got to our previous high point and pushed onward. The final pitch is supposed to be the most difficult: a 5.8 <em>lieback</em>. I was to lead that pitch. My partner, Eric, led an entire length of rope up to what we thought was the beginning of the final pitch. I followed, cleaning all the gear he left behind and towing the backpack. I felt like I weighed 300 pounds. It was so strenuous. This pitch was supposed to be 5.7 and I'm supposed to lead the next, <em>harder</em> one. Turns out Eric accidentally lead this one by going so far on the rope. The next section was easy, until we got off route. I heard Eric dry heaving after he got past a difficult section over a huge runout above a nut. I probably would have wet myself. We made it to the top just after nightfall. 
		<h3>Crest Jewel</h3>
		<p>Another route on North Dome in Yosemite! This is a low angle <em>slab</em> route. There are almost no handholds, instead you delicately place your feet on small features of the rock and trust that the rubber on your shoes will stick. The views were incredible!

		<h2>Training</h2>
		<p>Part of staying safe in the mountains is maintaining your fitness! A strong cardio system is vital, especially when the climb your dealing with has a long approach. Cycling and hiking are two ways I enjoy keeping up my cardio.  </p>
		<p>Still nothing gets you in better shape for climbing than <em>climbing!</em> Here I am toproping the crux of <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105722113/hot-rocks" target="_blank"><i>hotrocks</i>,</a> an 11.b finger crack.<big>(Beta Alert!)</big> This crack is particularly difficult because it is not a straight in crack. There are many features outside the crack itself that must be used as well as friction against the sides of the wall. It's sort of a puzzle.</p>

		<br><br>
		<div>The size of the crack varies with some being very wide and awkward such as this "offwidth" crack. Here, you can't quite jam your whole body in and it is too large to constrict around your hand. This makes the technique the most strenuous form of climbing, at least for me!</div>
