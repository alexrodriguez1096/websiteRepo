		<h1>Welcome to my climbing page!</h1>
		<br>
		<h3>How I started</h3>

		<p>I started rock climbing back in Dec. 2014 in Santa Cruz, Ca. My first climb ever attempted was at Castle Rock State Park, and called <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105734687/the-great-roof" target="_blank">"the Great Roof," </a> rated 5.10b. I struggled and pushed myself as hard as I could go and...
		<em>I failed!</em>
		</p>
		<p>Still I had a blast learning how to set up, stay safe and enjoy the physical and <em>mental</em> challenge that climbing entails. Later that week, I joined <a href="http://pacificedgeclimbinggym.com" target="_blank">Pacific Edge</a>, a local climbing gym and started honing my technique on a regular basis. That combined with reading and practicing safety skills lead to some fun adventures outside!</p>

		<h2><i>Noteworthy</i> climbs</h2>
		<h3 class="Nclimb">Regular Northwest Face of halfdome</h3>
		<p>My partner and I planned for ~15 hours of climbing. We wanted to start from the base and finish in the alpen glow.
			<br>
			We fixed 3 pitches of ropes and descended the night before our push, slept at the base, then woke up before 4am 
			and ascended the ropes. 
		</p>

		<h3 class="Nclimb">Son of Dawn Wall</h3>
		Whoever says climbing on the west side of Pinnacles is sketchy probably doesn't climb there enough. Once you get used to the strange rock, you can find yourself on some real gems. The squeeze chimney pitch on this climb is high up and as fun and protectable as they come. There was one pretty scary pitch leading up to it. 
		
		<h3 class ="Nclimb">South Face of Washington Column/Royal Arches Link-up</h3>
		<p>Royal Arches is always a fun climb on it's own. Combining it with North Dome's south face is really something to remember. Our first try, after completing the RA approach, we started up North Dome's left facing dihedral (pitch 2 on the dome, pitch 20 or so that day) and quickly realized we couldn't climb this style.</p> 
		We bailed.
		<p>The next morning we got on a single pitch <em>lieback</em> style of climbing down in the valley for practice. This closely models the climbing style high up on North Dome</p>
		<p>Our second attempt of the dome, we got to our previous high point and pushed onward. The final pitch is supposed to be the most difficult: a 5.8 <em>lieback</em>. I was to lead that pitch. My partner, Eric, led an entire length of rope up to what we thought was the beginning of the final pitch. I followed, cleaning all the gear he left behind and towing the backpack. I felt like I weighed 300 pounds. It was so strenuous. This pitch was supposed to be 5.7 and I'm supposed to lead the next, <em>harder</em> one. Turns out Eric accidentally lead this one by going so far on the rope. The next section was easy, until we got off route. I heard Eric dry heaving after he got past a difficult section over a huge runout above a nut. I probably would have wet myself. We made it to the top just after nightfall. 
		<h3 class="Nclimb">Crest Jewel</h3>
		<p>Another route on North Dome in Yosemite! This is a low angle <em>slab</em> route. There are almost no handholds, instead you delicately place your feet on small features of the rock and trust that the rubber on your shoes will stick. The views were incredible!

		<h2>Training</h2>
		<p>Part of staying safe in the mountains is maintaining your fitness! A strong cardio system is vital, especially when the climb your dealing with has a long approach. Cycling and hiking are two ways I enjoy keeping up my cardio.  </p>
		<p>Still nothing gets you in better shape for climbing than <em>climbing!</em> Here I am toproping the crux of <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105722113/hot-rocks" target="_blank"><i>hotrocks</i>,</a> an 11.b finger crack.<big>(Beta Alert!)</big> This crack is particularly difficult because it is not a straight in crack. There are many features outside the crack itself that must be used as well as friction against the sides of the wall. It's sort of a puzzle.</p>

		<br><br>
		<div>The size of the crack varies with some being very wide and awkward such as this "offwidth" crack. Here, you can't quite jam your whole body in and it is too large to constrict around your hand. This makes the technique the most strenuous form of climbing, at least for me!</div>
