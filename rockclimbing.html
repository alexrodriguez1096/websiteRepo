		<h1 style="color:orange">Welcome to my climbing page!</h1>
		<p>I started rock climbing back in Dec. 2014 in Santa Cruz, Ca. My first climb ever attempted was at Castle Rock State Park, and called <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105734687/the-great-roof" target="_blank">"the Great Roof," </a> rated 5.10b. I struggled and pushed myself as hard as I could go and...
		<em>I failed!</em>
		</p>
		<p>Still I had a blast learning the set up and safety protocal and combining he physical and <em>mental</em> challenge that climbing entails. Later that week, I joined <a href="http://pacificedgeclimbinggym.com" target="_blank">Pacific Edge</a>, a local climbing gym and started honing my technique on a regular basis. That combined with reading and practicing safety skills leads to some fun adventures outside!</p>

		<h3>Regular Northwest Face of halfdome</h3>
			
				<img src="doubleCracks.jpeg" height = 700>
				<p>July, 2018. The day after the park opened after being closed due to smoke, my partner and I headed up the "death slabs" to begin an epic Journey. Aiming to finish in a day, we packed light but came prepared to sleep on the wall. We did just that shortly after I led this pitch. 
			
		
		<h3>Son of Dawn Wall</h3>
		Whoever says climbing on the west side of Pinnacles is sketchy probably doesn't climb there enough. Once you get used strange rock, you can find yourself on some real gems. The squeeze chimney pitch on this climb is as fun and protectable as they come.
		
		<h3>South Face of Washington Column/Royal Arches Link-up</h3>
		<h3>Crest Jewel</h3>

			Here I am toproping the crux of <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105722113/hot-rocks" target="_blank"><i>hotrocks</i>,</a> an 11.b finger crack.<big>(Beta Alert!)</big> This crack is particularly difficult because it is not a straight in crack. There are many features outside the crack itself that must be used as well as friction against the sides of the wall.
<hr/>
			
			<img src="IMG_1202.jpg">
			<div>The size of the crack varies with some being very awkward such as this "offwidth" crack. Here, you can't quite jam your whole body in and it is too large to constrict around your hand. This makes the technique the most strenuous form of climbing, at least for me!
