	<h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
	<h4>I created this page to learn the basics of web development, share projects
		I'm working on, and list things that interest me personally. </h4>
	
	<h3>Python</h3>
	<a href="https://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">
		<img style="float:right;"src="https://projecteuler.net/images/euler_portrait.png">
	</a>
	<p>
		I dabble in 
		<a href="https://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">
			Project Euler
		</a> 
		and have completed the first 20 problems mostly using Python.
		Currently working out
		<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=21" target ="_blank"> problem 21</a>
		which deals with amicable numbers.
		I learned a cool method Euler used to find amicable numbers.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEh_4LQkkHU">Here</a> 
		is a link to a lecture on youtube where I studied that method. 
	</p>
	<p>I'm also working on a new <em>top secret</em> project to enhance my overall software/web 
		development skills. This will require collaboration with others. </p>
	<p style="clear:right;">Finally, I am working on finishing 
		<a href="https://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf"target="_blank">
		<em>Think Python</em>
		</a>
		a book I found online by Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner, and Chris Meyers.</p>
	
	<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
	<p>I started learning HTML in April 2019 by building this static website.
		My main source of reference has been
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">
			<img src="w3logo.png"style="vertical-align:middle;border:none;max-width:30%;max-height:8%">
		</a>
	</p>

	<h3>Preparing for Fall '19 @ <a href="https://www.csus.edu" target="_blank">CSUS</a></h3>
	<p>My course load this fall is: 
		<ul style="margin:15px;width:400px;background-color:green;border:solid;border-radius:10px;border-color:white;border-width:10px">
			<li>Network Analysis</li>
			<li>Engineering Economics, </li>
			<li>Applied Electromagnetics</li>
			<li>Intro to Logic Design </li>
			<li>Signals & Systems.</li>
			</ul>
	<em>First I'll need to brush up on some math!</em></p>
		
	<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
	<p>This has been my main athletic pursuit since 2015. I keep climbing because it 
		balances physical and mental challenges, gets me outside, and comes with a cool 
		network of people who share similar interests. Seriously! Everyone I've met who 
		climbs is pretty cool, both new people and veterans!</p>
	<p>This year (2019) I started training early in the season hoping to hop on the infamous 
		Yosemite climb, 
		<a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105845493/astroman" target="_blank">
			<i>astroman</i></a>. 
		I've been focusing on getting good at crack climbing, which is a difficult style to learn. 
		Early in the year, however, I injured my knee while skiing, so I've had to lower my 
		intensity.</p>
		
	</main>
	<p>
		I hope you enjoy what's here. Again, I will keep updating as I learn more about web
		development and enhance my skills elsewhere.</p>
