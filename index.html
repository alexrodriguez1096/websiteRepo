		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<h4>I've<big> just</big> started learning HTML.</h4> I started learning HTML in April 2019. The website you are viewing represents what I have learned so far. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg" target="blank">first HTML tutorial</a> video that got me started from giraffe tutorials.
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="blank"><big>w3schools.com</big></a> is a link to the tutorial I've been using to learn HTML more thoroughly.

		<h3>Reviewing Circuits and differential equations</h3>
		<p>I've reviewed almost all circuits that I've taken 3 years ago at Cabrillo college. I have just one chapter to cover on Laplace Transforms, but I need to review some DEs first!</p>
		<p>Soon I will be starting school at <a href="https://www.csus.edu" target="_blank"> Sac State </a>. I hope to complete a course of study in electrical and electronics engineering with power emphasis.

		<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
			<img src="/Users/zachary/Desktop/halfdome.jpg"
			
			<h4>This year (2019) I started training early in the season hoping to hop on the infamous Yosemite climb, <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105845493/astroman" target="_blank"><i>astroman</i></a>. I've been focusing on getting good at crack climbing, which is a difficult style to learn.
<hr/>
			<video height="600" poster="IMG_1234.jpg"src="video-1553537920.mp4" controls></video>
			<br>
			Here I am toproping the crux of <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105722113/hot-rocks" target="_blank"><i>hotrocks</i>,</a> an 11.b finger crack.<big>(Beta Alert!)</big> This crack is particularly difficult because it is not a straight forward crack. There are many features outside the crack itself that must be used as well as friction against the sides of the wall.
<hr/>
			
			<img src="IMG_1202.jpg">
			<div>The size of the crack varies with some being a very awkward size such as this "offwidth" crack. Here, you can't quite jam your whole body in the crack and the crack too large to get a constriction around your hand, which make this technique the most strenuous form of climbing, at least for me!

		I hope you've enjoyed this website so far. I'm looking forward to building it further. I want to ad more depth to links in my navigations section. In circuits it would be cool to post projects or problems I'm working on in some kind of interactive way.
