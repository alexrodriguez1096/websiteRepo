		<h3>Python</h3>
		<p>
		Currently working on problem 12 in <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=12" target ="_blank">project Euler</a>. Hopefully I can implement a dictionary to yield the answer in a timely manner.
		<h3>HTML</h3>
		I started learning HTML in April 2019. The website you are viewing represents what I have learned so far. I'll keep updating as I go.

		<h3>Reviewing Circuits and differential equations</h3>
		<p>I've reviewed almost all circuits that I've taken 3 years ago at Cabrillo college. I have just one chapter to cover on Laplace Transforms, but I need to review some DEs first!</p>
		<p>Soon I will be starting school at <a href="https://www.csus.edu" target="_blank"> Sac State </a>. I hope to complete a course of study in electrical and electronics engineering with power emphasis.

		<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
			<p>This has been my main athletic pursuit since 2015. I keep climbing because it balances physical and mental challenges, gets me outside, and comes with a cool network of people who share the same interests.</p>
			<p>This year (2019) I started training early in the season hoping to hop on the infamous Yosemite climb, <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105845493/astroman" target="_blank"><i>astroman</i></a>. I've been focusing on getting good at crack climbing, which is a difficult style to learn.</p>

		I hope you enjoy what's here. Again, I will keep updating as I learn more of the functionality in HTML and enhance my skills elsewhere.
