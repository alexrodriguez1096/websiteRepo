	<h1>Welcome to Zach's First Website!</h1>
	<h4>Here I wish to share my current list of projects and goals as well as a little about me. I hope you enjoy! </h4>
	
	<h3>Python</h3>
	<p>
	I am currently working on problem 21 in <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=21" target ="_blank">project Euler</a>. I learned a cool method Euler used to find amicable numbers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEh_4LQkkHU">Here			</a> is a link to a lecture on Euler's method for finding amicable numbers. Apparently he was a very smart dude.
	</p>
	<p>I'm also working on a new top secret project to enhance my overall software/web development skills. This will require collaboration
	with others, and so I need to learn <em>git</em> commands.
	</p>
	<p>
	Finally, I am working on finishing "Think Python," a book I found online by Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner, and Chris Meyers.
	</p>
	
	<h3>HTML</h3>
	<p>
	I started learning HTML in April 2019. This website represents what I have learned so far. I'll keep updating as I go.
	</p>

	<h3>Preparing for Fall '19</h3>
	<p>My course load this fall is: Network Analysis, Engineering Economics, Applied Electromagnetics, Intro to Logic Design, and Signals & Systems. First I'll need to brush up on some math!</p>
		
	<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
	<p>This has been my main athletic pursuit since 2015. I keep climbing because it balances physical and mental challenges, gets me outside, and comes with a cool network of people who share similar interests. Seriously! Everyone I've met who climbs is pretty cool, both new people and veterans!</p>
	<p>This year (2019) I started training early in the season hoping to hop on the infamous Yosemite climb, <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105845493/astroman" target="_blank"><i>astroman</i></a>. I've been focusing on getting good at crack climbing, which is a difficult style to learn. Early in the year, however, I injured my knee while skiing, so I've had to lower my intensity.</p>

	<p>
	I hope you enjoy what's here. Again, I will keep updating as I learn more of the functionality in HTML and enhance my skills elsewhere.
