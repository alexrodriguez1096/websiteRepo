	<h1 style="text-align:center; color:darkorange">Technical skills</h1> 
       	<p style="color:white">Currently, I'm learning html by constructing this website. I'm also familiar with C++ and am now focused on learning Python.</p>
	<h2>C++</h2>
	<p>I worked with C++ to design programs solving common problems such as implementing sorting algorithms using tools such as vectors, arrays and linked lists.</p>
	<h2>Python</h2>
	<p>Back when I was in discreet math, my instructor gave us a project: from a given set of airports, each with a list of possible flight connections, time of flight etc., find the shortest path between any two. I wrote a program using C++ that ended up being around 300 lines of code. It took me over a week, but it worked! A friend of mine used Python. He wrote 1 line of code.</p>
	<p>This spring and summer (2019) I plan to learn Python. I'm using text from <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/thinkCSpy.pdf" target="_blank" title="greenteapress.com">Think Python</a> and plan to upload some of the problems and programs I will be developing as I go.</p>
	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<p>I will continually be learning HTML and all the things that go along with web development. It already feels like a hobby!
