	<h1 style="text-align:center; color:darkorange">Technical skills</h1> 
	<p>Currently, I'm learning html by constructing this website. I'm also familiar with C++ and am now focused on learning Python.</p>
	<h2>VHDL/Verilog</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h2>C++</h2>
	<p>I worked with C++ to design programs solving common problems such as implementing sorting algorithms using tools such as vectors, arrays and linked lists.</p>
	<h2>Python</h2>
	<p>I started with python a few years ago but never learned it from the gound up. I've started this spring with <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/thinkCSpy.pdf" target="_blank" title="greenteapress.com">Think Python</a>  , a free online text. To test my skills, I'm using <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/about"  target = "_blank">Project Euler</a></p>
	<p>I've have so far solved the first 20 problems on project Euler, almost all with the use of Python, and almost all were using brute force. Quicker and more clever mathmatical methods are needed to speed up the computations. I've found a much quicker way to, for example, calculate large prime numbers by indexing each new prime into a set and dividing potential primes by each number in the set.</p>
	<p>I am now working on problem 21: finding the sum of all amicable numbers under 10000.</p>
	<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
	<p>This is my first foray into HTML and CSS. I started this website as a project to enhance my skills.
		I will be continually update and post links to other webpages I develop in the future.
