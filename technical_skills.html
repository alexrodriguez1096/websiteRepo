	<h1 style="text-align:center; color:darkorange">Technical skills</h1> 
       	<p style="color:white">Currently, I'm learning html by constructing this website. I'm also familiar with C++ and am now focused on learning Python.</p>
	<h2>C++</h2>
	<p>I worked with C++ to design programs solving common problems such as implementing sorting algorithms using tools such as vectors, arrays and linked lists.</p>
	<h2>Python</h2>
	<p>I started with python a few years ago but never learned it from the gound up. I've started this spring with <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/thinkCSpy.pdf" target="_blank" title="greenteapress.com">Think Python</a>  , a free online text. To test my skills, I'm using <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/about"  target = "_blank">Project Euler</a></p>
	<p>I recently implemented a problem using a dictionary. This was my first attempt that did not resort solely to brute force. I was able to find the Collatz sequence for a number under 1 million with the most terms. You can find that problem <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=14" target ="_blank">here</a></p>

	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<p>I will continually be learning HTML and all the things that go along with web development. It already feels like a hobby! Another thing I was told to use is Git. If your reading this, then I've learned how to use GitHub to host my website for FREE!</p>
