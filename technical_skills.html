	<h1>Technical skills</h1> 
	<p>Currently, I'm learning HTML/CSS by constructing this website. I'm also familiar with C++ and am now focused on
	  learning Python.</p>
	<h2>VHDL/Verilog</h2>
	<p>I began studying the basics of designing logic circuits with VHDL/Verilog this summer(2019) and
	  will delve further this fall as I begin my course of study @ CSUS. </p>
	<h2>C++</h2>
	<p>I worked with C++ to design programs solving common computational problems such as organizing data structures and
	  implementing sorting algorithms using language elements such as classes and objects, vectors, arrays and linked lists.</p>
	<h2>Python</h2>
	<p>I started learning python a few years ago but never learned it from the gound up. I've started this spring with
	  <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/thinkCSpy.pdf" target="_blank" title="greenteapress.com">Think Python</a>
	  , a free online text. To test my skills, I'm using
	  <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/about"  target = "_blank">Project Euler</a></p>
	<p>I've have so far solved the first 20 problems on project Euler, almost all with the use of Python, and almost all using
	  brute force. Quicker and more clever mathmatical methods are needed to speed up the computations. I've found a much quicker way
	  to, for example, calculate large prime numbers by indexing each new prime number I've found into a set and dividing potential
	  primes by each number in the set(I'll update soon with a sample of my code).</p>
	<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
	<p>This is my first foray into HTML and CSS. I started this website as a project to enhance my skillset and for networking purposes.
	  I will continually update content and style as well as post links to other webpages I develop in the future.
